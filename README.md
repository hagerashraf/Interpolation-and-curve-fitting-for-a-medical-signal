This project is about interpolation and curve fitting for a medical signal.

The user gets to choose a medical signal and see it in the curve fitting area, the order of the interpolation, number of chunks, also the mathematical equation of the fitting and the error mapping.

The following photos illustrate more about the GUI and the results after each orer from the user.

1- The following photo shows the GUI after choosing a signal.

2- The following two photos shows that there are two settings to zoom in or out from the graph

3-The following photo shows the result on the mathematic equation and the extrapolation on the signal after choosing number of chunks, order of interpolation and its type and also extrapolation percentage.

4- The following photo shows the results after changing the number of chunks to be 3 with a polyomial of 4th degree and also choosing to show the error mapping with overlapping percentage of 10 and choosing 
number of chunks as x-axis and interpolation order as y-axis.

5- This photo is after changing the axis.
